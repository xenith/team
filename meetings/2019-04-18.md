## Six-Week Sprint  
    - End date: 2019-05-02 (six weeks)
    - [Sprint goals](https://github.com/rustasync/team/blob/master/rfcs/0001-tide-roadmap.md)
        - Roadmap needs to be updated with already completed items
        - Open PR which adds cookie middleware and itâ€™s associated extension trait
            - We need to find a way to bring all extension traits into scope without manually add every one of them
        - Lots of open PRs and work around tide in the last week

## Working Group Updates  
    - Status updates
        - tide
            - Work on various crates to be compatible with the latest futures API on nightly
            - tide 0.1.0 release
            - Lots of discussions around authentication, static files and URL generation which is also on the roadmap for this sprint
                - Experimental implementation for serving static files ([GitHub](https://github.com/tomhoule/tide-static-files))
            - Dedicated issue for figuring out cross-framework middleware ([issue](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/164))
                - A path for that would be to find some least-common denominator trait for middleware, and then focus on developing cross-framework middleware 
            - Discussion needs to happen around crates which add functionality to tide. Discussion will happen on the RFC thread ([issue](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/162))
        - futures
            - Big breaking change (Context + Pin projection on the streams traits)
            - Sink is now generic over its item, makes it possible to implement it multiple times for a single type
            - FutureObj is deprecated, need to be swapped out for Pin<Box<dyn Future>> (will have an alias)
            - async specifics might move behind a feature so that we can have a version that will compile on 1.36 when futures_api is stable
        - runtime
            - Crate was released earlier this week ([reasoning](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/runtime/) | [crate](https://github.com/rustasync/runtime))
            - It abstracts romio+juliex, tokio and others in the future
            - It lives under the rustasync org 
        - romio + juliex
            - no time for it this meeting
        - async rust book
            - No progress this week
        - arewewebyet
            - no time for it this meeting
    - Issue triage ([org](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Arustasync) | [tide](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/))
