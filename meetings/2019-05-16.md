## Six-Week Sprint (2019-05-16 — 2019-06-20)
  - [Open `"``sprint``"` issues](https://github.com/orgs/rustasync/projects/1)
  - Board is open now, ToDos are added for all open issues 
  - How async-compression looks like right now will probably stay that way, aside from [asyncbufread](https://github.com/rustasync/async-compression/issues/21)
  - Writing a blog post about the [compression issue](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/26) so people know there is a compression middleware available (will be added to the sprint goals)

## Working Group Updates
  - tide
    - `tide-cors`: We can re-use some implementation from actix, also @Prasanna L implemented a small version for tide which can be extended
    - The modular split for tide came quite far: One PR is merged, the other one can maybe be merged this week; we should land the last PR as well before we push a new release
    - `app.serve` will return a Future, where `app.run` starts the server (still some examples are needed for use cases and how it used in the end)
    - futures
      - Futures has  a [new release(0.3.0-alpha.16)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/futures-rs/releases/tag/0.3.0-alpha.16) which supports the new .await syntax
      - We need to open a discussion about moving Futures off the `-alpha`/`-preview` releases once it’s stabilizes
      - `Stream` is part of `futures-core` which is intended to be non-breaking once it releases
      - `Sink` is in a separate `futures-sink` crate, which means breaking changes are possible
    - runtime
      - no updates this week
    - books
      - Discussion around the outline/content started ([link](https://github.com/rustasync/book/issues/1))
      - Open for input
      - No content yet
    - websites
      - No updates this week
  - PR sign off process
    - We need to establish basic, low key requirements to accept and merge pull requests
    - Maybe with the help of GitHub to set some requirements before a PR can be merged (minimum number of reviews for example)
    - PR has to be linked to an issue where consensus has been reached with regards to the general approach to solving the problem
    - The tool [bors](https://bors.tech/) might be a help with some of the issues
