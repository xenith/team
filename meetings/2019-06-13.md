## Working Group Updates
    - RFC Triage
        - One open RFC about extensible routing; needs more reviews ([link](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/pull/274/files))
    - Six-Week Sprint (2019-05-16 — 2019-06-20)
        - [Open `"``sprint``"` issues](https://github.com/orgs/rustasync/projects/1)
        - Current status: 6 items done, 6 in progress, 7 in todo
        - Session Management has to be picked up by someone ([issue](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/9#issuecomment-500628012))

## Status updates
        - tide
            - Current master fails to build with nightly after about 2019-06-01 (bug in the compiler). This is affecting people who want to use tide obviously as well ([issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61579))
            - The restructure PR has to be merged so we can continue the other open todos ([pr](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/pull/258))
            - testing framework is about to moved into its own submodule ([pr](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/pull/273))
        - futures
            - No updates this week
        - runtime
            - No updates this week
        - books
            - No updates, “get book outline” is still open ([issue](https://github.com/rustasync/book/issues/1))
            - The idea so far is moving it to a more cookbook style book
            - Weekly meetings to get the docs up to speed for async/await and 1.37; those will happen every Tuesday
            - CI is now in place to build the books
            - The book is being worked on this repository ([link](https://github.com/rust-lang/async-book))
            - The book has its own zulip stream ([link](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/login/#narrow/stream/201246-wg-async-foundations.2Fbook))
        - websites
            - No Updates this week
    - Pre-allocate agenda items
        - It would help the meeting in general to fill out the status updates before the meeting. The WASM WG is doing that and it seems to work quite well there.
