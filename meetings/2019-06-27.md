## Working Group Updates
    ### RFC Triage
        - Only open RFC is around extensible routing in tide ([link](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/pull/274)) and will be worked on in this upcoming sprint
    ### Sprint planning
        - Main focus is `runtime` this sprint
        - Working on the book should be a priority as well with RustConf approaching and Futures + async/await being stable (soon)
        - @Wim L git a tide web app running on runtime-native ([link](https://github.com/rustasync/tide/issues/276#issuecomment-505193372)) and will add examples
